# Keep App Clone

Bored of just putting my notes , So I build my own Keeper app.

This clone work as same as Google Keep App. I've used ReactJs, JavaScript , CSS, and HTML in this project.

In this, you can add and delete the notes. I've also added some icons from material-ui to make look similar to original app. 

Hope you like it :)
